In this project I designed a system that allows to transfer images and text via a radio link using OOK modulation.
Data encoding and decoding is done with two Arduino Nano microcontrollers, one of them is connected to an FM transmitter and the other - to an FM receiver.
The python code is created to send and read off data from the microcontrollers as well as to process this data.

Run all the Tx files on the transmitting setup and all Rx files on the receiving setup
